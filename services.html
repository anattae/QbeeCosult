                <h3 class="text-white bg-dark">STUDY IN EUROPE</h3>
                <P class="text-white">International experience has become more and more important in recent years. By
                  studying abroad in
                  Europe, you set the foundation for your career success. Many of the world’s best universities are
                  located in Europe. There are thousands of universities in Europe, offering countless study
                  programmes
                  in English. You can find programmes in any academic discipline ranging from Arts to Zoology, small
                  universities or large international research centres, cutting edge academic research programmes or
                  practice-oriented taught education. There is something for everybody.

                  There are also opportunities to stay back after the completion of your degree programme. That means
                  if
                  you decide to study in Europe, the chances are high that you will get a job offer and can stay for
                  the
                  longer term. In some European countries, there aren’t even any tuition fees - studying at the
                  university is free of charge! There are also lots of scholarship opportunities and other options for
                  financial support during your studies.

                  When you study in Europe, you should use the chance to see other countries. Thanks to a wealth of
                  cheap flights, trains and bus connections, and relatively short travel times, that is even possible
                  on
                  a limited student budget and with tight semester schedules. Bachelor or Master in Europe follows the
                  same general academic framework; so if you obtain your Master’s degree in Sweden, it will be
                  equivalent to a Master’s degree from Germany, Lithuania or the United Kingdom. There are countless
                  Bachelors and Masters in English that you can choose from. In most European countries, the
                  proficiency
                  in English is generally very high. That means even if you struggle to learn the basics in Polish,
                  Portuguese or Swedish, you can always get by with English in everyday situations.

                  Our specialized team of professionals will provide you with the highest level of service as you
                  begin
                  your journey to studying and living in any part of Europe. Our dedicated experts will help you find
                  the right program/institution based on your needs, and once you have made your choice, details will
                  be
                  provided on necessary requirements to apply for admissions and you will be guided every step of the
                  way. Once you’ve been accepted into a European Institution and you accept the Offer, we’ll provide
                  expert visa advisory support you as you apply for a study visa.

                  <p class="text-white">The UK education system is highly respected and valued all over the world. It
                    is a hospitable, diverse and highly popular destination for International students. The UK has
                    been welcoming international students from all over the world for over 500 years. Our past
                    clients/students have described the UK as one of the best places to study, work and live. There
                    are some UK degrees that can be fast-racked and completed in three years with honours (saving a
                    year of tuition). International students in the UK have access to comprehensive medical care
                    through the NHS if they are studying for more than six months. There are a rich variety of
                    institutions to make a choice from: the traditional UK universities that have taught for
                    hundreds
                    of years, the modern, state-of-the-art universities and colleges.

                    The UK is full of diverse cultures, ancient landmarks and has a rich mix of multicultural cities
                    and country side in the four major regions: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As
                    one
                    of the world’s Global forces and one of the oldest sovereign nations, the UK has had a
                    significant
                    influence on the cultural practices of many countries across the globe including the United
                    States. The English language was first spoken in early medieval years in England. It is
                    currently
                    the official language of the UK with roughly 95% of the population speaking as monolingual. The
                    constantly evolving English language has had 1,400 years of development from its West Germanic
                    roots to its current form. This language has drawn influence from Latin and French as well as
                    Norse. It is not only the main language in Britain but is also one of the most-spoken language
                    in
                    the world and the most widespread language in the world.

                    The UK has a rich history in literature. There are literary pieces written in Celtic languages
                    and
                    Old English. Over the centuries, Britain has produced renowned writers including William
                    Shakespeare, John Milton, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. The works of William Shakespeare,
                    specifically Romeo and Juliet, have been read by millions of people across the globe and as of
                    2017 it had been translated into at least 100 languages. J.K. Rowling is one of UK’s most
                    prolific
                    writers of the 21st century with her Harry Potter series sold over half a billion copies,
                    ranking
                    as the best-selling book series of all time. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings both written by
                    J.R.R. Tolkien are also UK literary works that rank among the top 10 bestselling books in the
                    world. They have since been adapted into award-winning movies.

                    Music plays a crucial role in Britain’s pop culture. The UK has produced some world-renowned
                    musicians like the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Adele who have all had an immense influence
                    on
                    both the British and global music scenes. The United Kingdom has played an essential role in the
                    inception, growth, and development of some of the world’s most popular sports such as football,
                    golf, rugby, and tennis. The English Premier League is one of the world’s most-viewed sports
                    tournaments drawing viewership of more than 160 million people from more than 200 countries
                    across
                    the globe. In the UK the weather is pretty unpredictable and outfits are seasonally worn; winter
                    outfits, summer clothing etc.

                    The UK was founded as a Christian country with the Anglican Church being the main denomination.
                    Britain is, however, becoming less and less of a Christian country with lower number of people
                    in
                    attendance of church service on Sunday. Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam have large followership in
                    the UK. Fashion in Britain has undergone a massive transformation over the years. London is
                    today
                    the fashion capital of the UK. The city is home to some of the world’s most renowned fashion
                    brands including Paul Smith, Christopher Kane, and many others. The domestic value of the
                    fashion
                    industry in the UK is estimated to be around $88 billion.

                    As a politically and economically strong country, the UK has always been a hub for immigration.
                    People who come to live in UK continue to communicate with each other on their native language.
                    The UK hosts the largest population of Indians outside India and also has the fifth-largest
                    community of Jews in the world. Thus, there are many other languages spoken in the UK by
                    different
                    smaller minorities. In London, for example, there are around 300 languages spoken in small
                    units;
                    families. Two year post study work visa is currently available to International students after
                    completion of their programme. Thus you are guaranteed an additional time period of 24months
                    after
                    completion of your programme to gain work experience. A UK degree will give you the competitive
                    edge in any career and that is why this is a top choice for International students globally.

                    <p class="card-text">The UK education system is highly respected and valued all over the world. It
                      is a hospitable, diverse and highly popular destination for International students. The UK has
                      been welcoming international students from all over the world for over 500 years. Our past
                      clients/students have described the UK as one of the best places to study, work and live. There
                      are some UK degrees that can be fast-racked and completed in three years with honours (saving a
                      year of tuition). International students in the UK have access to comprehensive medical care
                      through the NHS if they are studying for more than six months. There are a rich variety of
                      institutions to make a choice from: the traditional UK universities that have taught for
                      hundreds
                      of years, the modern, state-of-the-art universities and colleges.

                      The UK is full of diverse cultures, ancient landmarks and has a rich mix of multicultural cities
                      and country side in the four major regions: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As
                      one
                      of the world’s Global forces and one of the oldest sovereign nations, the UK has had a
                      significant
                      influence on the cultural practices of many countries across the globe including the United
                      States. The English language was first spoken in early medieval years in England. It is
                      currently
                      the official language of the UK with roughly 95% of the population speaking as monolingual. The
                      constantly evolving English language has had 1,400 years of development from its West Germanic
                      roots to its current form. This language has drawn influence from Latin and French as well as
                      Norse. It is not only the main language in Britain but is also one of the most-spoken language
                      in
                      the world and the most widespread language in the world.

                      The UK has a rich history in literature. There are literary pieces written in Celtic languages
                      and
                      Old English. Over the centuries, Britain has produced renowned writers including William
                      Shakespeare, John Milton, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. The works of William Shakespeare,
                      specifically Romeo and Juliet, have been read by millions of people across the globe and as of
                      2017 it had been translated into at least 100 languages. J.K. Rowling is one of UK’s most
                      prolific
                      writers of the 21st century with her Harry Potter series sold over half a billion copies,
                      ranking
                      as the best-selling book series of all time. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings both written by
                      J.R.R. Tolkien are also UK literary works that rank among the top 10 bestselling books in the
                      world. They have since been adapted into award-winning movies.

                      Music plays a crucial role in Britain’s pop culture. The UK has produced some world-renowned
                      musicians like the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Adele who have all had an immense influence
                      on
                      both the British and global music scenes. The United Kingdom has played an essential role in the
                      inception, growth, and development of some of the world’s most popular sports such as football,
                      golf, rugby, and tennis. The English Premier League is one of the world’s most-viewed sports
                      tournaments drawing viewership of more than 160 million people from more than 200 countries
                      across
                      the globe. In the UK the weather is pretty unpredictable and outfits are seasonally worn; winter
                      outfits, summer clothing etc.

                      The UK was founded as a Christian country with the Anglican Church being the main denomination.
                      Britain is, however, becoming less and less of a Christian country with lower number of people
                      in
                      attendance of church service on Sunday. Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam have large followership in
                      the UK. Fashion in Britain has undergone a massive transformation over the years. London is
                      today
                      the fashion capital of the UK. The city is home to some of the world’s most renowned fashion
                      brands including Paul Smith, Christopher Kane, and many others. The domestic value of the
                      fashion
                      industry in the UK is estimated to be around $88 billion.

                      As a politically and economically strong country, the UK has always been a hub for immigration.
                      People who come to live in UK continue to communicate with each other on their native language.
                      The UK hosts the largest population of Indians outside India and also has the fifth-largest
                      community of Jews in the world. Thus, there are many other languages spoken in the UK by
                      different
                      smaller minorities. In London, for example, there are around 300 languages spoken in small
                      units;
                      families. Two year post study work visa is currently available to International students after
                      completion of their programme. Thus you are guaranteed an additional time period of 24months

                <p>
                  Today, North American continent consist of three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the
                  Caribbean. It also includes the world's largest island Greenland and the sovereign states of Canada,
                  the United States Mexico and many more. All of these make North American continent the third largest
                  continent in the world by geographical area. The most widely spoken languages in North America are
                  English, Spanish, and to a lesser extent French. North America is one of the most popular study
                  destinations in the world for international students. The quality of education is generally high
                  While
                  studying here as an international student, you will have a chance to experience the nature’s beauty
                  by
                  taking trips to various locations on your bucket list. If you ever visualised a road trip across the
                  American states or to see a polar bear in the wild this is your lucky opportunity! Some of the
                  world’s
                  biggest and most innovative companies are located in the biggest hubs of North America: New York
                  Metro
                  Area, the Silicon Valley, Greater Toronto Area, just to name a few.
                  The students you’ll meet during your studies in North America will come from the most diverse
                  cultural
                  backgrounds. Both Canada and the United States are welcoming countries that respect and embrace the
                  world’s cultures. Many international holidays are celebrated in North America to make international
                  student, immigrants, and tourists to feel at home: Chinese New Year, St. Patrick’s Day, Rosh
                  Hashanah,
                  Eid Al Fitr, Diwali, and many others. North America’s human landscape closely mirrors that of its
                  physical environment: varied, rich, and constantly changing. From their beginnings to the present
                  day,
                  the peoples of North America have worked with and against their surroundings in order to thrive.
                  Tourism is also an important part of North America’s economy, especially for the small island
                  nations
                  of the Caribbean Sea. These island nations offer pristine tropical environments. Their
                  multi-coloured
                  coral reefs are one of the premier diving destinations in the world. The islands’ historical ties to
                  the United States and Europe ease travel arrangements and language barriers. The islands host about
                  20
                  million visitors every year. Immigrants have sought opportunities, particularly in the United States
                  and Canada, for hundreds of years. Immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America have
                  contributed to the development of the continent. Immigrants or children of immigrants to North
                  America
                  have become scientific, business, and cultural leaders. The grading system and GPA in the U.S. can
                  be
                  confusing, especially for international students and that is one of the several reasons to take

                    The United States is the third largest country in the world. In addition to
                    Native Americans who were already living on the continent, the population of the United States was
                    built on immigration from other countries. Despite recent moves to close the U.S. borders to new
                    immigrants and refugees, a new immigrant moves to the United States every 33 seconds, according to
                    the Census Bureau. The culture of the United States of America is primarily of Western origin, but
                    influenced by a multicultural ethos that includes African, Native American, Asian, Pacific Island,
                    and Latin American people and their cultures. As a result, the United States is one of the most
                    culturally diverse countries in the world. Nearly every region of the world has influenced
                    American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s.
                    The U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Native Americans, Latin Americans,
                    Africans and Asians.
                    American universities are widely known for the quality of their teaching and research. The
                    education system in USA is the most versatile and flexible higher education system for
                    international students in the world today. According to a recent survey, about 30 percent of all
                    current international students in the world are studying in the United States. Qualifications
                    awarded by U.S. universities are recognized throughout the world for its academic brilliance.
                    America’s contribution to the world in diverse ways cannot be summarised in a few sentences. What
                    would the world’s history books be without Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Dr Martin Luther
                    King, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and many more? The contributions of notable American
                    personalities to the fields of art, literature, business, science and music are legendary.
                    American literature very much came to the fore in the nineteenth century and continued ever since.
                    Famous American writers include Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald ,Ernest Hemingway and more
                    recently George R Martins (author of A song of Ice and Fire which became adapted into one of the
                    world’s most watched television series spanning April 2011- May 2019: Game of Thrones)
                    Probably every foreigner’s introduction to America is via Hollywood and music. So famous and
                    popular is Hollywood that it has even inspired spin-offs all over the world in the form of
                    Bollywood, Ghallywood, Nollywood, Wellywood, and more. Amongst the many contributions that America
                    has made to the world, its influence in the field of music is one of the most impactful. From the
                    rock-n-roll rhythms of Elvis Presley, the soulful jazz and blues of Billie Holiday, the
                    foot-stomping tracks of Michael Jackson, the country classics of Johnny Cash, the hard rock music
                    of Guns n Roses, the pop songs of Madonna, hip-hop tracks of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Eminem, Jay-Z,
                    Kanye and many more internationally acclaimed musicians. All of these genres of music: Jazz, Rock,
                    Grunge, Country, Hip-Hop, RnB are but some of the many genres of music created in the USA and
                    exported worldwide and very much the rave currently.
                    Sport is very popular in the USA with American football, baseball, and basketball and ice- hockey
                    being the most popular. The USA traditionally does very well in the Olympics. Art is also very
                    popular in the US with galleries to be found nationwide. Jackson Pollack and Andy Warhol are two
                    of the country’s globally recognised artists. The United States has been described as the most
                    famous country in the world. But what makes America so famous? Attractions such as the Grand
                    Canyon and Mount Rushmore naturally come to mind, as are its lasting imprints on global culture,
                    such as Hollywood, music, sports, historical personalities, tech innovation, and more. Americans
                    take pride in honouring their historical personalities. The most unique of all American landmarks
                    is Mount Rushmore. No other country can boast of celebrating their past leaders in such a splendid
                    manner. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial depicts towering granite faces of former US
                    presidents; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The site
                    also features a museum with interactive exhibitions.

                    The Grand Canyon really is one of those places whose magnificence you can truly behold only when
                    you see it live. The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon, river valley carved by the Colorado
                    River in Arizona, United States. Whilst it is not the deepest canyon in the world (Kali Gandaki
                    Gorge in Nepal is much deeper), however, the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming
                    size and its intricate and multi-coloured landscape. The idea of being self-sufficient and being
                    on your own is highly valued in the U.S and as such the entrepreneurship spirit is embedded deep
                    into the psyche of Americans. America is home to the most number of inventions and innovations in
                    the world. IBM made personal computers an affordable reality, Microsoft Windows digitalized the
                    desktop operations of the workspace, Google brought the world’s information to our fingertips,
                    Facebook made the world smaller and Apple popularized touch technology. All these are American

                  <p class="text-white">Canada is the second largest country in the world by geographical measurement.
                    A Canadian degree is internationally accepted worldwide. In recent times, Canadian Universities
                    are ranked in the top 50 universities in the world. There’s a wide array of Canadian institutions
                    to choose from, but whether you attend a university, college, or a vocational school, there’s no
                    doubt that a Canadian education is world-class. International students in Canada are eligible to
                    work up to 20 hours per week during school terms and full-time (30 hours/week) during scheduled
                    breaks like summer vacation. Most students don’t need a work permit to work while they study,
                    whether their job is on campus or off campus. However, your study permit will indicate whether
                    you’re allowed to work off campus.

                    The Institute for Economics & Peace ranked Canada as the 8th most peaceful country in the world in
                    2016. Unlike most other countries, Canada is pretty isolated in terms of location. It’s protected
                    on three sides by oceans, and only shares a border with the United States. That distance provides
                    a bit of a buffer from most international conflicts. Canada has a democratically elected
                    government, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of those living in Canada are protected by the
                    Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada has a well-deserved international reputation as a
                    tolerant and non-discriminatory society. Immigrants make up a fifth of Canada’s entire population,
                    and Canadian laws ensure that all people, regardless of their circumstance, are protected from
                    discrimination.
                    Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions,
                    especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures. Over time, elements of the
                    cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated to form a Canadian cultural
                    assortment. Canada has long since adopted multiculturalism as official national policy. Canada has
                    a lot of programs designed to encourage international students to transition to a permanent
                    resident after their studies. Options like the Post-Graduation Work Permit let graduates stay and
                    work on an open work permit after graduation and give them an opportunity to get some Canadian
                    work experience.
                    English and French are both official languages in Canada and share equal status, but anywhere you
                    choose to go in Canada, you can easily survive just by speaking and communicating in English.
                    However, while in Canada, you can seize the opportunity and learn French. The Canadian university
                    degree program directory provides numerous undergraduate, graduate and doctorate degree co-op
                    programs encompassing different academic disciplines of study for international students to pick
                    from. Thus, while you study and after you graduate, you can gain experience working for industry
                    leading companies in Canada. If you choose to return to your home country, your Canadian
                    education, and improved language ability in either English or French, could help open doors to
                    working in global organizations. Canadian work experience and education are highly valued
                    everywhere in the world, so this increases your chances of getting employed globally.

                    Our specialized team of professionals will provide you with the highest level of service as you
                    begin your journey to studying and living in Canada. Our dedicated experts will help you find the

                    <p class="card-text">The United States is the third largest country in the world. In addition to
                      Native Americans who were already living on the continent, the population of the United States was
                      built on immigration from other countries. Despite recent moves to close the U.S. borders to new
                      immigrants and refugees, a new immigrant moves to the United States every 33 seconds, according to
                      the Census Bureau. The culture of the United States of America is primarily of Western origin, but
                      influenced by a multicultural ethos that includes African, Native American, Asian, Pacific Island,
                      and Latin American people and their cultures. As a result, the United States is one of the most
                      culturally diverse countries in the world. Nearly every region of the world has influenced
                      American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s.
                      The U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Native Americans, Latin Americans,
                      Africans and Asians.
                      American universities are widely known for the quality of their teaching and research. The
                      education system in USA is the most versatile and flexible higher education system for
                      international students in the world today. According to a recent survey, about 30 percent of all
                      current international students in the world are studying in the United States. Qualifications
                      awarded by U.S. universities are recognized throughout the world for its academic brilliance.
                      America’s contribution to the world in diverse ways cannot be summarised in a few sentences. What
                      would the world’s history books be without Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Dr Martin Luther
                      King, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and many more? The contributions of notable American
                      personalities to the fields of art, literature, business, science and music are legendary.
                      American literature very much came to the fore in the nineteenth century and continued ever since.
                      Famous American writers include Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald ,Ernest Hemingway and more
                      recently George R Martins (author of A song of Ice and Fire which became adapted into one of the
                      world’s most watched television series spanning April 2011- May 2019: Game of Thrones)
                      Probably every foreigner’s introduction to America is via Hollywood and music. So famous and
                      popular is Hollywood that it has even inspired spin-offs all over the world in the form of
                      Bollywood, Ghallywood, Nollywood, Wellywood, and more. Amongst the many contributions that America
                      has made to the world, its influence in the field of music is one of the most impactful. From the
                      rock-n-roll rhythms of Elvis Presley, the soulful jazz and blues of Billie Holiday, the
                      foot-stomping tracks of Michael Jackson, the country classics of Johnny Cash, the hard rock music
                      of Guns n Roses, the pop songs of Madonna, hip-hop tracks of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Eminem, Jay-Z,
                      Kanye and many more internationally acclaimed musicians. All of these genres of music: Jazz, Rock,
                      Grunge, Country, Hip-Hop, RnB are but some of the many genres of music created in the USA and
                      exported worldwide and very much the rave currently.
                      Sport is very popular in the USA with American football, baseball, and basketball and ice- hockey
                      being the most popular. The USA traditionally does very well in the Olympics. Art is also very
                      popular in the US with galleries to be found nationwide. Jackson Pollack and Andy Warhol are two
                      of the country’s globally recognised artists. The United States has been described as the most
                      famous country in the world. But what makes America so famous? Attractions such as the Grand
                      Canyon and Mount Rushmore naturally come to mind, as are its lasting imprints on global culture,
                      such as Hollywood, music, sports, historical personalities, tech innovation, and more. Americans
                      take pride in honouring their historical personalities. The most unique of all American landmarks
                      is Mount Rushmore. No other country can boast of celebrating their past leaders in such a splendid
                      manner. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial depicts towering granite faces of former US
                      presidents; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The site
                      also features a museum with interactive exhibitions.

                      The Grand Canyon really is one of those places whose magnificence you can truly behold only when
                      you see it live. The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon, river valley carved by the Colorado
                      River in Arizona, United States. Whilst it is not the deepest canyon in the world (Kali Gandaki
                      Gorge in Nepal is much deeper), however, the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming
                      size and its intricate and multi-coloured landscape. The idea of being self-sufficient and being
                      on your own is highly valued in the U.S and as such the entrepreneurship spirit is embedded deep
                      into the psyche of Americans. America is home to the most number of inventions and innovations in
                      the world. IBM made personal computers an affordable reality, Microsoft Windows digitalized the
                      desktop operations of the workspace, Google brought the world’s information to our fingertips,
                      Facebook made the world smaller and Apple popularized touch technology. All these are American

                <P class="text-white">South America is the fourth largest continent in the word and it has several
                  breath-taking landscapes, ancient ruins, and natural wonders. The culture of South America today
                  stems
                  from a diverse set of cultural traditions, dating back to those of pre-Columbian civilisations and
                  indigenous tribes, which have mixed with those of African slaves as well as Asian and European
                  immigrants. This vibrant and unique cultural mix is reflected not only in popular culture, but food,
                  architecture, religion and music across the continent, making it a fascinating part of the world to
                  visit. Most Latin American populations trace their roots back to indigenous European, African, and
                  Asian origins, creating a diverse fusion of cultures. For example, in Brazil, you’ll see the
                  influences of the largest African diaspora in the world in the cuisine, music, dance, and religions.
                  Across the Andes, you may hear indigenous dialects of Quechua being spoken. When studying abroad in
                  the Americas, there’s no doubt that you’ll see evidence of the region’s multiculturalism.
                  South America has the largest waterfall system in the world, and countless UNESCO World Heritage
                  sites. It’s also an affordable destination full of diversity and language engagement opportunities.
                  Everyday items and services like groceries, taxi rides, public transportation and dining out also
                  tend
                  to be affordable in South America than some of the other regions of the world. Exposure to unique
                  cultures is one of the many perks to studying in South America. In addition to cultural, ethnical,
                  and
                  linguistic diversity, biological diversity, there are many activities to indulge in; sandboarding in
                  the desert, surfing in the Pacific, skiing in the mountains and lots more.

                    Brazil
                    has the most famous and celebrated carnival festival in the world. Brazil has the world's
                    largest

                    portion of the continent of Asia. Arabic is the official language of the UAE although English is
                    widely spoken and understood. The UAE is home to a large expatriate community, a number of other
                    languages are widely spoken such as Persian, Hindi, Urdu and Chinese. The United Arab Emirates
                    are
                    a unique spot for conducting business, vacations and in recent times, a Country for global
                    education. The UAE Emiratis are predominantly Sunni Muslims and all social and political matters
                    are driven by Sharia (Islamic) law. However, the UAE is tolerant of other religions and accords
                    religious freedom to the expatriate population. These religions primarily include Hinduism,
                    Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhism. Although Muslims can proselytise to those of other faiths,
                    it
                    is forbidden for those of other faiths to proselytise to Muslims. This is important to note for
                    International students practising other religions aside Islam.
                    Although traditionally, Emirati culture has been based upon a patriarchal society, the UAE fully

                      widely spoken and understood. The UAE is home to a large expatriate community, a number of other
                      languages are widely spoken such as Persian, Hindi, Urdu and Chinese. The United Arab Emirates
                      are
                      a unique spot for conducting business, vacations and in recent times, a Country for global
                      education. The UAE Emiratis are predominantly Sunni Muslims and all social and political matters
                      are driven by Sharia (Islamic) law. However, the UAE is tolerant of other religions and accords
                      religious freedom to the expatriate population. These religions primarily include Hinduism,
                      Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhism. Although Muslims can proselytise to those of other faiths,
                      it
                      is forbidden for those of other faiths to proselytise to Muslims. This is important to note for
                      International students practising other religions aside Islam.
                      Although traditionally, Emirati culture has been based upon a patriarchal society, the UAE fully

                <P class="text-white">Found in the Tropical Pacific region surrounded by palm trees, Oceania is the
                  collective name for Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the smaller islands of Melanesia,
                  Micronesia, and Polynesia. A relatively young area with regards to colonization, Oceania was settled
                  beginning in the late 18th century and cumulatively remains largely uninhabited due to a
                  considerable
                  expanse of desert found in Australia. While this being true, Oceania still boasts a population of
                  roughly 378 million. A melting pot of cultures, here you’ll find territories of the U.S, France,
                  U.K.,
                  and Chile—influences that add to the uniqueness already provided by the native islanders.
                  If you enjoy being near the ocean, and want the chance to enjoy a vastly different learning
                  experience, explore the options each country has to offer. Oceania is comprised of over 10,000
                  islands; you’ll be able to choose from a selection of regions guaranteed to make you want to dive
                  right in to your studies. Study abroad destinations in Oceania include: Australia, Fiji, New
                  Zealand,
                  Papua New Guinea, Polynesia, Samoa, Tahiti and others. Sydney is the most multicultural city in
                  Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking
                  a
                  language other than English with themselves.
                  The easiest way to explore neighbouring countries is by plane. Major hubs in Sydney and Auckland
                  connect with smaller islands that have national airlines. While some cities are more easily
                  connected,
                  patience is helpful when trying to get to less-frequently-travelled locales. Don’t let that stop
                  you;
                  remember, you’ve come all this way to see the world! What can you expect while studying abroad in an
                  Oceania region? It’s a given you’ll enjoy a mild climate and enviable access to the nearest beach,
                  but
                  you may also find welcoming communities; people here are well known for their relaxed take on life
                  and
                  respectful natures. A few things to note: The official language of most countries is English,

                    facilities are easily available and at affordable costs.
                    New Zealand’s culture is a Western culture, which is influenced by the cultural input of the
                    indigenous Māori and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British
                    colonisation of New Zealand. Asides from the high standard to education in New Zealand, it is
                    also
                    an exotic destination due to its stunning natural environment, unique culture and endless
                    possibilities within adventure and sports. Studying in New Zealand is an adventurous experience
                    in
                    a country with magnificent landscapes and coastlines that encompass distinct biodiversity of
                    animal, fungal and plant life. Get ready to engage in outdoor activities that make the most of

                    Zealand, movies such as Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia and
                    others. The Higher Education System in New Zealand is to an even greater degree based on the
                    British system with a very similar structure. This means that qualifications gained in New
                    Zealand
                    or partial qualifications can often be transferred freely within New Zealand and with
                    institutions

                <P class="text-white">Do you wish to experience one of the most diverse and complex continents in the
                  world? Then you should consider studying in Africa. By studying in one of the most complex
                  continents
                  in the world you will get a rich experience. Africa is not just about complex politics and human
                  diversity; if you are a person who loves outdoor exploration and adventure then Africa deserves some
                  thought and consideration. Africa also has some drawbacks; poverty and corruption amongst other
                  vices
                  are a reality in Africa. For the globally minded student these are not seen as disadvantages but
                  rather global challenges to tackle.
                  Studying in Africa means that you will be able to enjoy lower living costs and highly affordable
                  fees.
                  The culture is also something of interest. Once you are settled into your new surroundings you
                  should
                  definitely check out some of the tours that are on offer to international students in the location
                  you
                  are. There are internship opportunities and job-shadowing options in some institutions in Africa.
                  Business, Tourism, Law, Commerce and Education courses are all popular Bachelor Degrees that you can
                  study in Africa. Some Universities also offer joint degree programs.

                  Pole. The freezing, inhospitable continent of Antarctica was the last place on Earth to be explored.
                  Antarctica does not belong to any nation, but is governed under an international treaty that
                  prevents
                  countries from exploiting its land. Antarctica is the only continent on Earth without indigenous
                  human
                  inhabitants. Today, Antarctica is designated as “a continent for science”. There are currently no
                  Universities there as there are no indigenous inhabitants. However, Scientists visit Antarctica to
                  study the climate, weather, geology, and wildlife of this freezing, unique region. Research so far
                  has
                  helped to highlight global problems, such as climate change.

                  <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                    interests and budget. The ideal destination will vary based on your study abroad goals. When picking
                    a
                    location, consider what type of living experience you want, available funds, your preferred
                    geographical environment (weather and culture). If you’ve always wanted to explore other countries
                    while studying, consider studying at a university that gives you the chance and visa to explore
                    other
                    countries. Your study abroad experience is truly a product of what you make of it, so choose your
                    new
                    home and study destination based on the factors that you need to thrive. It is extremely important
                    that you pick a destination that you love, want to explore and that is within your budget.
                    Most Higher Education providers choose their locations based on several factors, including safety.
                    If
                    you’re unsure about a certain location, please ask our specialists safety questions that you may
                    have.
                    Of course, mishaps happen anywhere and everywhere in the world, but the chances are higher in some
                    Countries than others. You may also want to consider if your preferred program has a lot of other
                    international students especially if you love meeting people from diverse nationalities and making
                    new
                    friends. Always, factor in the exchange rate and average cost of living in preferred location before
                    you make a final decision.
                    Study abroad is a time to enrich your educational experience – not cause additional stress—hence one
                    of the reasons to make use of our specialized service tailored to your unique needs. We will ensure

                  <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                    interests and budget. It is highly essential when deciding on your dream program and location to set
                    a
                    realistic budget. Consider what you need versus what you want. If you’re looking to be as
                    cost-effective as possible, you may need to make a few compromises with yourself in choosing your
                    program. For example, a course that includes an additional study abroad year different from the
                    country you intend to study at may sound amazing but in reality, you may not be able to afford the
                    extra cost that comes with it. Instead, you could opt for a program that offers placement and would
                    give you the opportunity to earn while studying. You also may want to make a list of things that you
                    need in a program as against superfluous perks that you want and see where you may be able to cut
                    costs.
                    Costs always vary based on where you decide to go and selected program. When choosing the best
                    program
                    for you, think of the extra factors that you need to budget for such as living expenses,
                    transportation in your new city. Different countries have different living expenses and this is a
                    very
                    important factor to consider in addition to tuition fees which vary in figures from low to high
                    depending on the University, its world ranking and location. Also important to note is the currency
                    exchange rate which differs from one country to another.
                    If you’re not too confident in your ability to stick to a budget while living abroad, then you may
                    want to consider a program that has more inclusive packages such as outright payment of yearly
                    accommodation costs in addition to paying full tuition fees. There are so many different types of
                    programs out there, when discussing with our study abroad consultants; be honest with your budget
                    and
                    expectations and that way we will provide tips on locations, Universities and courses in your budget
                    range. Don’t forget to research scholarship and funding opportunities too! We will do our best to
                    provide hints on available scholarships and funding opportunities.</p>

                        record, convictions, arrests, deportation from any country or previous ban details. In cases
                        such

                  interests and budget. The ideal destination will vary based on your study abroad goals. When picking a
                  location, consider what type of living experience you want, available funds, your preferred
                  geographical environment (weather and culture). If you’ve always wanted to explore other countries
                  while studying, consider studying at a university that gives you the chance and visa to explore other
                  countries. Your study abroad experience is truly a product of what you make of it, so choose your new
                  home and study destination based on the factors that you need to thrive. It is extremely important
                  that you pick a destination that you love, want to explore and that is within your budget.
                  Most Higher Education providers choose their locations based on several factors, including safety. If
                  you’re unsure about a certain location, please ask our specialists safety questions that you may have.
                  Of course, mishaps happen anywhere and everywhere in the world, but the chances are higher in some
                  Countries than others. You may also want to consider if your preferred program has a lot of other
                  international students especially if you love meeting people from diverse nationalities and making new
                  friends. Always, factor in the exchange rate and average cost of living in preferred location before
                  you make a final decision.
                  Study abroad is a time to enrich your educational experience – not cause additional stress—hence one
                  of the reasons to make use of our specialized service tailored to your unique needs. We will ensure
                  your application stays on track and that you meet all major requirements before you apply to a
                  specific program. Program lengths vary significantly.</p>

                <h3>STRATEGIC BUDGET MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget. It is highly essential when deciding on your dream program and location to set a
                  realistic budget. Consider what you need versus what you want. If you’re looking to be as
                  cost-effective as possible, you may need to make a few compromises with yourself in choosing your
                  program. For example, a course that includes an additional study abroad year different from the
                  country you intend to study at may sound amazing but in reality, you may not be able to afford the
                  extra cost that comes with it. Instead, you could opt for a program that offers placement and would
                  give you the opportunity to earn while studying. You also may want to make a list of things that you
                  need in a program as against superfluous perks that you want and see where you may be able to cut
                  costs.
                  Costs always vary based on where you decide to go and selected program. When choosing the best program
                  for you, think of the extra factors that you need to budget for such as living expenses,
                  transportation in your new city. Different countries have different living expenses and this is a very
                  important factor to consider in addition to tuition fees which vary in figures from low to high
                  depending on the University, its world ranking and location. Also important to note is the currency
                  exchange rate which differs from one country to another.
                  If you’re not too confident in your ability to stick to a budget while living abroad, then you may
                  want to consider a program that has more inclusive packages such as outright payment of yearly
                  accommodation costs in addition to paying full tuition fees. There are so many different types of
                  programs out there, when discussing with our study abroad consultants; be honest with your budget and
                  expectations and that way we will provide tips on locations, Universities and courses in your budget
                  range. Don’t forget to research scholarship and funding opportunities too! We will do our best to
                  provide hints on available scholarships and funding opportunities.</p>

                    <li>We practice mock interviews with clients to ensure they are comfortable interacting effectively
                      with the consular officer. Interviews are conducted in English and mock interviews cover tips on
                      how the program you are applying for fits career plan, valid reasons for choosing desired program,
                      employment prospects afterwards, research plans if applicable. It will also pin point and address

                      addressed before final interview. Explanation of plan to return home after the completion of
                      studies. Address maintenance of dependents (when applicable) while away on study and other

                      situation and visa history are addressed in detail taking into great consideration review of
                      countries’ specific requirements.</li>
                    <li>Other Special Considerations: Social media question on visa applications. We encourage clients
                      to be conscious of the use of social media as this may be scrutinized for country-specific visa
                      application.</li>
                    <li>Immigration history: It is important to keep track of every past immigration history, every visa
                      issued, refusals, overstay in visited countries and make known every detail so that we can address
                      any issues in the application and or refer you to an immigration lawyer depending on the severity
                      of the case.</li>
                    <li>Administrative processing delays – Sometimes delays occur due to different reasons and
                      applications can be tracked online for some countries.</li>
                    <li>Third country nationals for clients who are not citizens or permanent residents of the country
                      in which they currently live or the country where they plan to apply for a visa (i.e. you are a
                      "third country national). A valid explanation has to be given on why application is being made in
                      a country different from home country and explain plan to return to that country or home country
                      upon completion of studies.</li>
                    <li>Criminal records: Honesty is the best policy and clients should indicate every criminal
                      record, convictions, arrests, deportation from any country or previous ban details. In cases such
                      as these, we encourage Clients to seek the professional services of an experienced immigration
                      attorney to address current or past legal issues.</li>
                    <li>Final check of all visa application documents to ensure all requirements have been met before
                      submission. The Visa application process is comprehensive and takes a lot of time and that is why
                      we encourage students to apply as soon as possible. To prevent delays and last minute rush.</li>

                    to do
                    so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government

                  </p>
                  <h3>Other legal requirements</h3>
                  <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
                    to:

                  <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                  <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
                    over
                    the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially
                    acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>






                  <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                  <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You
                    are
                    aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that
                    We
                    have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental
                    consent, We

                  <p>We also may limit how We collect, use, and store some of the information of Users between 13 and 18
                    years
                    old. In some cases, this means We will be unable to provide certain functionality of the Service to
                    these
                    users.</p>
                  <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                    requires
                    consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
                    information.
