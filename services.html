                <h3>SELECT YOUR PREFERRED COURSE</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget.<br>At <span class="qbee">QBEE CONSULTS</span> we do our best to ensure you make
                  the best choice of course and
                  institution. A great way to begin is to take personality and career tests that will easily identify
                  your
                  strength and weaknesses and look towards what naturally interests you. If you already know what
                  courses
                  interest you, then you have started down the right route!
                  There are Varieties of programs offered globally and a chat with one of our Virtual Education
                  Consultants
                  can steer you in the right path. Are you looking to develop global career-forward skills with a
                  service-learning experience? Or are you a student who wants to switch careers? Or learn something new?
                  Or
                  become the expert in your current field? Whatever your reasons are for going abroad, you’re bound to
                  find
                  a study abroad program that works for you. It’s up to you to choose courses that interest you the
                  most,
                  whether that’s finance, education, business, science, hospitality or other subjects that you wish to
                  explore. You may also want to consider taking a unique course that your home country may not offer or
                  just
                  a few institutions in your country offers it. E.g. Polymer and textile engineering in Nigeria is
                  currently
                  only being offered by one or two Institutions in the country.

                <h3>SELECT YOUR STUDY DESTINATION</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget. The ideal destination will vary based on your study abroad goals. When picking a
                  location, consider what type of living experience you want, available funds, your preferred
                  geographical environment (weather and culture). If you’ve always wanted to explore other countries
                  while studying, consider studying at a university that gives you the chance and visa to explore other
                  countries. Your study abroad experience is truly a product of what you make of it, so choose your new
                  home and study destination based on the factors that you need to thrive. It is extremely important
                  that you pick a destination that you love, want to explore and that is within your budget.
                  Most Higher Education providers choose their locations based on several factors, including safety. If
                  you’re unsure about a certain location, please ask our specialists safety questions that you may have.
                  Of course, mishaps happen anywhere and everywhere in the world, but the chances are higher in some
                  Countries than others. You may also want to consider if your preferred program has a lot of other
                  international students especially if you love meeting people from diverse nationalities and making new
                  friends. Always, factor in the exchange rate and average cost of living in preferred location before
                  you make a final decision.
                  Study abroad is a time to enrich your educational experience – not cause additional stress—hence one
                  of the reasons to make use of our specialized service tailored to your unique needs. We will ensure
                  your application stays on track and that you meet all major requirements before you apply to a
                  specific program. Program lengths vary significantly.</p>

                <h3>STRATEGIC BUDGET MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget. It is highly essential when deciding on your dream program and location to set a
                  realistic budget. Consider what you need versus what you want. If you’re looking to be as
                  cost-effective as possible, you may need to make a few compromises with yourself in choosing your
                  program. For example, a course that includes an additional study abroad year different from the
                  country you intend to study at may sound amazing but in reality, you may not be able to afford the
                  extra cost that comes with it. Instead, you could opt for a program that offers placement and would
                  give you the opportunity to earn while studying. You also may want to make a list of things that you
                  need in a program as against superfluous perks that you want and see where you may be able to cut
                  costs.
                  Costs always vary based on where you decide to go and selected program. When choosing the best program
                  for you, think of the extra factors that you need to budget for such as living expenses,
                  transportation in your new city. Different countries have different living expenses and this is a very
                  important factor to consider in addition to tuition fees which vary in figures from low to high
                  depending on the University, its world ranking and location. Also important to note is the currency
                  exchange rate which differs from one country to another.
                  If you’re not too confident in your ability to stick to a budget while living abroad, then you may
                  want to consider a program that has more inclusive packages such as outright payment of yearly
                  accommodation costs in addition to paying full tuition fees. There are so many different types of
                  programs out there, when discussing with our study abroad consultants; be honest with your budget and
                  expectations and that way we will provide tips on locations, Universities and courses in your budget
                  range. Don’t forget to research scholarship and funding opportunities too! We will do our best to
                  provide hints on available scholarships and funding opportunities.</p>

                      situation and visa history are addressed in detail taking into great consideration review of
                      countries’ specific requirements.</li>
                    <li>Other Special Considerations: Social media question on visa applications. We encourage clients
                      to be conscious of the use of social media as this may be scrutinized for country-specific visa
                      application.</li>
                    <li>Immigration history: It is important to keep track of every past immigration history, every visa
                      issued, refusals, overstay in visited countries and make known every detail so that we can address
                      any issues in the application and or refer you to an immigration lawyer depending on the severity
                      of the case.</li>
                    <li>Administrative processing delays – Sometimes delays occur due to different reasons and
                      applications can be tracked online for some countries.</li>
                    <li>Third country nationals for clients who are not citizens or permanent residents of the country
                      in which they currently live or the country where they plan to apply for a visa (i.e. you are a
                      "third country national). A valid explanation has to be given on why application is being made in
                      a country different from home country and explain plan to return to that country or home country
                      upon completion of studies.</li>
                    <li>Criminal records: Honesty is the best policy and clients should indicate every criminal
                      record, convictions, arrests, deportation from any country or previous ban details. In cases such
                      as these, we encourage Clients to seek the professional services of an experienced immigration
                      attorney to address current or past legal issues.</li>
                    <li>Final check of all visa application documents to ensure all requirements have been met before
                      submission. The Visa application process is comprehensive and takes a lot of time and that is why
                      we encourage students to apply as soon as possible. To prevent delays and last minute rush.</li>
