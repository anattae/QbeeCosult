                <h3 class="text-white bg-dark">STUDY IN EUROPE</h3>
                <P class="text-white">International experience has become more and more important in recent years. By
                  studying abroad in
                  Europe, you set the foundation for your career success. Many of the world’s best universities are
                  located in Europe. There are thousands of universities in Europe, offering countless study
                  programmes
                  in English. You can find programmes in any academic discipline ranging from Arts to Zoology, small
                  universities or large international research centres, cutting edge academic research programmes or
                  practice-oriented taught education. There is something for everybody.

                  There are also opportunities to stay back after the completion of your degree programme. That means
                  if
                  you decide to study in Europe, the chances are high that you will get a job offer and can stay for
                  the
                  longer term. In some European countries, there aren’t even any tuition fees - studying at the
                  university is free of charge! There are also lots of scholarship opportunities and other options for
                  financial support during your studies.

                  When you study in Europe, you should use the chance to see other countries. Thanks to a wealth of
                  cheap flights, trains and bus connections, and relatively short travel times, that is even possible
                  on
                  a limited student budget and with tight semester schedules. Bachelor or Master in Europe follows the
                  same general academic framework; so if you obtain your Master’s degree in Sweden, it will be
                  equivalent to a Master’s degree from Germany, Lithuania or the United Kingdom. There are countless
                  Bachelors and Masters in English that you can choose from. In most European countries, the
                  proficiency
                  in English is generally very high. That means even if you struggle to learn the basics in Polish,
                  Portuguese or Swedish, you can always get by with English in everyday situations.

                  Our specialized team of professionals will provide you with the highest level of service as you
                  begin
                  your journey to studying and living in any part of Europe. Our dedicated experts will help you find
                  the right program/institution based on your needs, and once you have made your choice, details will
                  be
                  provided on necessary requirements to apply for admissions and you will be guided every step of the
                  way. Once you’ve been accepted into a European Institution and you accept the Offer, we’ll provide
                  expert visa advisory support you as you apply for a study visa.

                    <p class="card-text">The UK education system is highly respected and valued all over the world. It
                      is a hospitable, diverse and highly popular destination for International students. The UK has
                      been welcoming international students from all over the world for over 500 years. Our past
                      clients/students have described the UK as one of the best places to study, work and live. There
                      are some UK degrees that can be fast-racked and completed in three years with honours (saving a
                      year of tuition). International students in the UK have access to comprehensive medical care
                      through the NHS if they are studying for more than six months. There are a rich variety of
                      institutions to make a choice from: the traditional UK universities that have taught for
                      hundreds
                      of years, the modern, state-of-the-art universities and colleges.

                      The UK is full of diverse cultures, ancient landmarks and has a rich mix of multicultural cities
                      and country side in the four major regions: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As
                      one
                      of the world’s Global forces and one of the oldest sovereign nations, the UK has had a
                      significant
                      influence on the cultural practices of many countries across the globe including the United
                      States. The English language was first spoken in early medieval years in England. It is
                      currently
                      the official language of the UK with roughly 95% of the population speaking as monolingual. The
                      constantly evolving English language has had 1,400 years of development from its West Germanic
                      roots to its current form. This language has drawn influence from Latin and French as well as
                      Norse. It is not only the main language in Britain but is also one of the most-spoken language
                      in
                      the world and the most widespread language in the world.

                      The UK has a rich history in literature. There are literary pieces written in Celtic languages
                      and
                      Old English. Over the centuries, Britain has produced renowned writers including William
                      Shakespeare, John Milton, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. The works of William Shakespeare,
                      specifically Romeo and Juliet, have been read by millions of people across the globe and as of
                      2017 it had been translated into at least 100 languages. J.K. Rowling is one of UK’s most
                      prolific
                      writers of the 21st century with her Harry Potter series sold over half a billion copies,
                      ranking
                      as the best-selling book series of all time. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings both written by
                      J.R.R. Tolkien are also UK literary works that rank among the top 10 bestselling books in the
                      world. They have since been adapted into award-winning movies.

                      Music plays a crucial role in Britain’s pop culture. The UK has produced some world-renowned
                      musicians like the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Adele who have all had an immense influence
                      on
                      both the British and global music scenes. The United Kingdom has played an essential role in the
                      inception, growth, and development of some of the world’s most popular sports such as football,
                      golf, rugby, and tennis. The English Premier League is one of the world’s most-viewed sports
                      tournaments drawing viewership of more than 160 million people from more than 200 countries
                      across
                      the globe. In the UK the weather is pretty unpredictable and outfits are seasonally worn; winter
                      outfits, summer clothing etc.

                      The UK was founded as a Christian country with the Anglican Church being the main denomination.
                      Britain is, however, becoming less and less of a Christian country with lower number of people
                      in
                      attendance of church service on Sunday. Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam have large followership in
                      the UK. Fashion in Britain has undergone a massive transformation over the years. London is
                      today
                      the fashion capital of the UK. The city is home to some of the world’s most renowned fashion
                      brands including Paul Smith, Christopher Kane, and many others. The domestic value of the
                      fashion
                      industry in the UK is estimated to be around $88 billion.

                      As a politically and economically strong country, the UK has always been a hub for immigration.
                      People who come to live in UK continue to communicate with each other on their native language.
                      The UK hosts the largest population of Indians outside India and also has the fifth-largest
                      community of Jews in the world. Thus, there are many other languages spoken in the UK by
                      different
                      smaller minorities. In London, for example, there are around 300 languages spoken in small
                      units;
                      families. Two year post study work visa is currently available to International students after
                      completion of their programme. Thus you are guaranteed an additional time period of 24months
                      after
                      completion of your programme to gain work experience. A UK degree will give you the competitive
                      edge in any career and that is why this is a top choice for International students globally.

                <p>
                  Today, North American continent consist of three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the
                  Caribbean. It also includes the world's largest island Greenland and the sovereign states of Canada,
                  the United States Mexico and many more. All of these make North American continent the third largest
                  continent in the world by geographical area. The most widely spoken languages in North America are
                  English, Spanish, and to a lesser extent French. North America is one of the most popular study
                  destinations in the world for international students. The quality of education is generally high
                  While
                  studying here as an international student, you will have a chance to experience the nature’s beauty
                  by
                  taking trips to various locations on your bucket list. If you ever visualised a road trip across the
                  American states or to see a polar bear in the wild this is your lucky opportunity! Some of the
                  world’s
                  biggest and most innovative companies are located in the biggest hubs of North America: New York
                  Metro
                  Area, the Silicon Valley, Greater Toronto Area, just to name a few.
                  The students you’ll meet during your studies in North America will come from the most diverse
                  cultural
                  backgrounds. Both Canada and the United States are welcoming countries that respect and embrace the
                  world’s cultures. Many international holidays are celebrated in North America to make international
                  student, immigrants, and tourists to feel at home: Chinese New Year, St. Patrick’s Day, Rosh
                  Hashanah,
                  Eid Al Fitr, Diwali, and many others. North America’s human landscape closely mirrors that of its
                  physical environment: varied, rich, and constantly changing. From their beginnings to the present
                  day,
                  the peoples of North America have worked with and against their surroundings in order to thrive.
                  Tourism is also an important part of North America’s economy, especially for the small island
                  nations
                  of the Caribbean Sea. These island nations offer pristine tropical environments. Their
                  multi-coloured
                  coral reefs are one of the premier diving destinations in the world. The islands’ historical ties to
                  the United States and Europe ease travel arrangements and language barriers. The islands host about
                  20
                  million visitors every year. Immigrants have sought opportunities, particularly in the United States
                  and Canada, for hundreds of years. Immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America have
                  contributed to the development of the continent. Immigrants or children of immigrants to North
                  America
                  have become scientific, business, and cultural leaders. The grading system and GPA in the U.S. can
                  be
                  confusing, especially for international students and that is one of the several reasons to take

                    <p class="card-text">The United States is the third largest country in the world. In addition to
                      Native Americans who were already living on the continent, the population of the United States was
                      built on immigration from other countries. Despite recent moves to close the U.S. borders to new
                      immigrants and refugees, a new immigrant moves to the United States every 33 seconds, according to
                      the Census Bureau. The culture of the United States of America is primarily of Western origin, but
                      influenced by a multicultural ethos that includes African, Native American, Asian, Pacific Island,
                      and Latin American people and their cultures. As a result, the United States is one of the most
                      culturally diverse countries in the world. Nearly every region of the world has influenced
                      American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s.
                      The U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Native Americans, Latin Americans,
                      Africans and Asians.
                      American universities are widely known for the quality of their teaching and research. The
                      education system in USA is the most versatile and flexible higher education system for
                      international students in the world today. According to a recent survey, about 30 percent of all
                      current international students in the world are studying in the United States. Qualifications
                      awarded by U.S. universities are recognized throughout the world for its academic brilliance.
                      America’s contribution to the world in diverse ways cannot be summarised in a few sentences. What
                      would the world’s history books be without Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Dr Martin Luther
                      King, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and many more? The contributions of notable American
                      personalities to the fields of art, literature, business, science and music are legendary.
                      American literature very much came to the fore in the nineteenth century and continued ever since.
                      Famous American writers include Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald ,Ernest Hemingway and more
                      recently George R Martins (author of A song of Ice and Fire which became adapted into one of the
                      world’s most watched television series spanning April 2011- May 2019: Game of Thrones)
                      Probably every foreigner’s introduction to America is via Hollywood and music. So famous and
                      popular is Hollywood that it has even inspired spin-offs all over the world in the form of
                      Bollywood, Ghallywood, Nollywood, Wellywood, and more. Amongst the many contributions that America
                      has made to the world, its influence in the field of music is one of the most impactful. From the
                      rock-n-roll rhythms of Elvis Presley, the soulful jazz and blues of Billie Holiday, the
                      foot-stomping tracks of Michael Jackson, the country classics of Johnny Cash, the hard rock music
                      of Guns n Roses, the pop songs of Madonna, hip-hop tracks of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Eminem, Jay-Z,
                      Kanye and many more internationally acclaimed musicians. All of these genres of music: Jazz, Rock,
                      Grunge, Country, Hip-Hop, RnB are but some of the many genres of music created in the USA and
                      exported worldwide and very much the rave currently.
                      Sport is very popular in the USA with American football, baseball, and basketball and ice- hockey
                      being the most popular. The USA traditionally does very well in the Olympics. Art is also very
                      popular in the US with galleries to be found nationwide. Jackson Pollack and Andy Warhol are two
                      of the country’s globally recognised artists. The United States has been described as the most
                      famous country in the world. But what makes America so famous? Attractions such as the Grand
                      Canyon and Mount Rushmore naturally come to mind, as are its lasting imprints on global culture,
                      such as Hollywood, music, sports, historical personalities, tech innovation, and more. Americans
                      take pride in honouring their historical personalities. The most unique of all American landmarks
                      is Mount Rushmore. No other country can boast of celebrating their past leaders in such a splendid
                      manner. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial depicts towering granite faces of former US
                      presidents; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The site
                      also features a museum with interactive exhibitions.

                      The Grand Canyon really is one of those places whose magnificence you can truly behold only when
                      you see it live. The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon, river valley carved by the Colorado

                    <p class="card-text">Canada is the second largest country in the world by geographical measurement.
                      A Canadian degree is internationally accepted worldwide. In recent times, Canadian Universities
                      are ranked in the top 50 universities in the world. There’s a wide array of Canadian institutions
                      to choose from, but whether you attend a university, college, or a vocational school, there’s no
                      doubt that a Canadian education is world-class. International students in Canada are eligible to
                      work up to 20 hours per week during school terms and full-time (30 hours/week) during scheduled
                      breaks like summer vacation. Most students don’t need a work permit to work while they study,
                      whether their job is on campus or off campus. However, your study permit will indicate whether
                      you’re allowed to work off campus.

                      The Institute for Economics & Peace ranked Canada as the 8th most peaceful country in the world in
                      2016. Unlike most other countries, Canada is pretty isolated in terms of location. It’s protected
                      on three sides by oceans, and only shares a border with the United States. That distance provides
                      a bit of a buffer from most international conflicts. Canada has a democratically elected
                      government, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of those living in Canada are protected by the
                      Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada has a well-deserved international reputation as a
                      tolerant and non-discriminatory society. Immigrants make up a fifth of Canada’s entire population,
                      and Canadian laws ensure that all people, regardless of their circumstance, are protected from
                      discrimination.
                      Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions,
                      especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures. Over time, elements of the
                      cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated to form a Canadian cultural
                      assortment. Canada has long since adopted multiculturalism as official national policy. Canada has
                      a lot of programs designed to encourage international students to transition to a permanent
                      resident after their studies. Options like the Post-Graduation Work Permit let graduates stay and
                      work on an open work permit after graduation and give them an opportunity to get some Canadian
                      work experience.
                      English and French are both official languages in Canada and share equal status, but anywhere you
                      choose to go in Canada, you can easily survive just by speaking and communicating in English.
                      However, while in Canada, you can seize the opportunity and learn French. The Canadian university
                      degree program directory provides numerous undergraduate, graduate and doctorate degree co-op
                      programs encompassing different academic disciplines of study for international students to pick
                      from. Thus, while you study and after you graduate, you can gain experience working for industry
                      leading companies in Canada. If you choose to return to your home country, your Canadian
                      education, and improved language ability in either English or French, could help open doors to
                      working in global organizations. Canadian work experience and education are highly valued
                      everywhere in the world, so this increases your chances of getting employed globally.

                <h3 class="text-white bg-dark">STUDY IN SOUTH AMERICA</h3>
                <P class="text-white">South America is the fourth largest continent in the word and it has several
                  breath-taking landscapes, ancient ruins, and natural wonders. The culture of South America today
                  stems
                  from a diverse set of cultural traditions, dating back to those of pre-Columbian civilisations and
                  indigenous tribes, which have mixed with those of African slaves as well as Asian and European
                  immigrants. This vibrant and unique cultural mix is reflected not only in popular culture, but food,
                  architecture, religion and music across the continent, making it a fascinating part of the world to
                  visit. Most Latin American populations trace their roots back to indigenous European, African, and
                  Asian origins, creating a diverse fusion of cultures. For example, in Brazil, you’ll see the
                  influences of the largest African diaspora in the world in the cuisine, music, dance, and religions.
                  Across the Andes, you may hear indigenous dialects of Quechua being spoken. When studying abroad in
                  the Americas, there’s no doubt that you’ll see evidence of the region’s multiculturalism.
                  South America has the largest waterfall system in the world, and countless UNESCO World Heritage
                  sites. It’s also an affordable destination full of diversity and language engagement opportunities.
                  Everyday items and services like groceries, taxi rides, public transportation and dining out also
                  tend
                  to be affordable in South America than some of the other regions of the world. Exposure to unique
                  cultures is one of the many perks to studying in South America. In addition to cultural, ethnical,
                  and
                  linguistic diversity, biological diversity, there are many activities to indulge in; sandboarding in
                  the desert, surfing in the Pacific, skiing in the mountains and lots more.
                  Students who are studying Spanish or Portuguese often prefer this region for its immersive nature.
                  If
                  you’ve been studying one of these languages and are looking to take your skills to the next level,
                  consider studying there as day to day interaction is certain to improve your language skill.
                  Generally
                  speaking, South (Latin) America may not be top choice for most but there is so much personal growth
                  achievable by stepping outside of your comfort zone. In such a different region, you will gain
                  valuable life lessons and a broader understanding of the world. Although it may be challenging
                  initially, you’re sure to stick out from the crowd in your next interview if you can provide
                  real-life
                  examples of multi-ethnic understanding.
                  Our specialized team of professionals will provide you with the highest level of service as you
                  begin
                  your journey to studying and living in South America. Our dedicated experts will help you find the

                    <p class="card-text">With more than 4,500 miles of coastline, 2,000 beaches, and almost 25 percent
                      of the world’s rainforests, Brazil has been deemed a geographically “megadiverse” country
                      because
                      of its abundance of natural attractions and wildlife. While the cities and beaches may be
                      crowded
                      with tourists and native alike, however, there’s a whole different side to Brazil: according to
                      anthropologists: there are as many as 60 undiscovered tribes existing in its dense jungles!
                      Brazil
                      has the most famous and celebrated carnival festival in the world. Brazil has the world's
                      largest
                      beach at 24,606 feet long. It is the longest country in the world from north to south via land,
                      spanning approximately 2,800 miles. The culture of Brazil is primarily Western, but presents a
                      very diverse nature showing the ethnic and cultural mix that occurred during the colonial period
                      involving mostly Indigenous people of the coastal and most accessible riverine areas, Portuguese
                      people and African people especially Yoruba’s.
                      It may interest you to know that in September 2018, Yoruba was recognised as part of the
                      cultural
                      heritage of Rio de Janeiro, while English and Portuguese remains the official languages with
                      Portuguese being spoken by at least 98% of the population. In order to study in Brazil, you'll
                      need to prove your proficiency in Portuguese - even if you're studying a course delivered in
                      English, this happens to be a major drawback for most foreigners. However, Portuguese is a very
                      popular language spoken globally and it is sure to enhance students aspiring to be competitive
                      in
                      the global marketplace.
                      Brazil doesn’t just excel at soccer. In fact the country’s higher education star is quickly
                      rising. Of its more than 2,600 public and private institutions, 17 made the Top 800 in the
                      2013/14
                      QS World University Rankings. Public and private institutions alike are known for their
                      exceptional quality of facilities and faculty as well as a comprehensive range of course
                      offerings
                      and commitment to social inclusion. There is always some kind of street celebration happening in
                      Brazil. From music and atmosphere to its amazing street food, Brazil offers an extraordinarily
                      rich and vibrant culture because of the largely immigrant composition of approximately 180
                      million
                      people. Brazilians are also notoriously friendly, making it a particularly warm and welcoming
                      place to visit. Brazilian food offers an abundance of international appeal whether you're
                      sampling
                      Gourmet Street fair or attending a culinary festival. Brazil is also great for further
                      exploring;
                      it serves as a gateway to popular South American sites including Buenos Aires, Patagonia, Machu
                      Picchu and The Andes

                      portion of the continent of Asia. Arabic is the official language of the UAE although English is
                      widely spoken and understood. The UAE is home to a large expatriate community, a number of other
                      languages are widely spoken such as Persian, Hindi, Urdu and Chinese. The United Arab Emirates

                      are driven by Sharia (Islamic) law. However, the UAE is tolerant of other religions and accords
                      religious freedom to the expatriate population. These religions primarily include Hinduism,
                      Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhism. Although Muslims can proselytise to those of other faiths,
                      it
                      is forbidden for those of other faiths to proselytise to Muslims. This is important to note for
                      International students practising other religions aside Islam.
                      Although traditionally, Emirati culture has been based upon a patriarchal society, the UAE fully
                      endorses gender equality, guaranteeing equal rights for both sexes. According to the World
                      Economic Forum 2016, the UAE are a leading country in the region for equality. Until recent

                      foreign nationals from other countries. However, the UAE has created such conditions of life and

                      hospitality, strong sense of tradition, and great sense of humour. They welcome people from all
                      over the world, and are anxious to share their culture and values. The UAE offers a wide range

                  smallest of the world's continents. Australia is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in the
                  world today. Almost one in four Australian residents were born outside of Australia and many more

                <P class="text-white">Found in the Tropical Pacific region surrounded by palm trees, Oceania is the
                  collective name for Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the smaller islands of Melanesia,
                  Micronesia, and Polynesia. A relatively young area with regards to colonization, Oceania was settled
                  beginning in the late 18th century and cumulatively remains largely uninhabited due to a
                  considerable
                  expanse of desert found in Australia. While this being true, Oceania still boasts a population of
                  roughly 378 million. A melting pot of cultures, here you’ll find territories of the U.S, France,
                  U.K.,
                  and Chile—influences that add to the uniqueness already provided by the native islanders.
                  If you enjoy being near the ocean, and want the chance to enjoy a vastly different learning
                  experience, explore the options each country has to offer. Oceania is comprised of over 10,000
                  islands; you’ll be able to choose from a selection of regions guaranteed to make you want to dive
                  right in to your studies. Study abroad destinations in Oceania include: Australia, Fiji, New
                  Zealand,
                  Papua New Guinea, Polynesia, Samoa, Tahiti and others. Sydney is the most multicultural city in
                  Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking
                  a
                  language other than English with themselves.
                  The easiest way to explore neighbouring countries is by plane. Major hubs in Sydney and Auckland
                  connect with smaller islands that have national airlines. While some cities are more easily
                  connected,
                  patience is helpful when trying to get to less-frequently-travelled locales. Don’t let that stop
                  you;
                  remember, you’ve come all this way to see the world! What can you expect while studying abroad in an
                  Oceania region? It’s a given you’ll enjoy a mild climate and enviable access to the nearest beach,
                  but
                  you may also find welcoming communities; people here are well known for their relaxed take on life
                  and
                  respectful natures. A few things to note: The official language of most countries is English,
                  meaning
                  you’ll find many courses taught in English (though you will find many other spoken languages
                  depending
                  on where you visit). Whereas higher education used to be contained to the larger areas of Australia
                  and New Zealand, a demand from current and potential students has led to an expansion of programs
                  and
                  degrees being offered throughout the Oceania region.
                  If you’re seeking an out-of-this-world experience, then consider studying abroad in Oceania.

                      indigenous Māori and the various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the British
                      colonisation of New Zealand. Asides from the high standard to education in New Zealand, it is
                      also

                      Cyprus is one of the oldest countries in the world in terms of archaeological evidence. There
                      are
                      archaeological evidences showing settlements dating back to more than 9000 years ago. It is a
                      Mediterranean island located south of Turkey, southeast of Greece, north of Egypt, northwest of
                      Israel and Lebanon, and west of Syria. Geographically, Cyprus is closer to Asia but it is
                      historically and culturally a European country. One major event history shared with Nigeria is
                      the
                      fact that the two countries gained independence in the year 1960.
                      If you are looking for a warm place to study, Cyprus is a great option as it has the warmest
                      winters and the temperature in the open sea hovers around 16° or 17° C in winter, which is
                      really
                      not too bad in comparison to elsewhere in Europe. The island is generally basked in the warm sun
                      the whole year round. Cyprus offers top class education at very affordable fees. Most of the
                      population of Cyprus is multilingual and English is a commonly spoken language here which offers
                      a
                      supportive environment to International Students. Cyprus offers work opportunities to
                      International students, there are a number of work opportunities in hospitality, hotel,
                      Information technology and finance sectors. Students usually have twenty to thirty working hours
                      per week.

                  diversity; if you are a person who loves outdoor exploration and adventure then Africa deserves some
                  thought and consideration. Africa also has some drawbacks; poverty and corruption amongst other
                  vices
                  are a reality in Africa. For the globally minded student these are not seen as disadvantages but
                  rather global challenges to tackle.

                  fees.
                  The culture is also something of interest. Once you are settled into your new surroundings you
                  should
                  definitely check out some of the tours that are on offer to international students in the location
                  you
                  are. There are internship opportunities and job-shadowing options in some institutions in Africa.

                  Pole. The freezing, inhospitable continent of Antarctica was the last place on Earth to be explored.
                  Antarctica does not belong to any nation, but is governed under an international treaty that
                  prevents
                  countries from exploiting its land. Antarctica is the only continent on Earth without indigenous
                  human
                  inhabitants. Today, Antarctica is designated as “a continent for science”. There are currently no
                  Universities there as there are no indigenous inhabitants. However, Scientists visit Antarctica to
                  study the climate, weather, geology, and wildlife of this freezing, unique region. Research so far
                  has
                  helped to highlight global problems, such as climate change.

                      Or
                      become the expert in your current field? Whatever your reasons are for going abroad, you’re bound to
                      find
                      a study abroad program that works for you. It’s up to you to choose courses that interest you the
                      most,
                      whether that’s finance, education, business, science, hospitality or other subjects that you wish to
                      explore. You may also want to consider taking a unique course that your home country may not offer or
                      just
                      a few institutions in your country offers it. E.g. Polymer and textile engineering in Nigeria is
                      currently
                      only being offered by one or two Institutions in the country.

                    <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                      interests and budget. The ideal destination will vary based on your study abroad goals. When picking a
                      location, consider what type of living experience you want, available funds, your preferred
                      geographical environment (weather and culture). If you’ve always wanted to explore other countries
                      while studying, consider studying at a university that gives you the chance and visa to explore other
                      countries. Your study abroad experience is truly a product of what you make of it, so choose your new
                      home and study destination based on the factors that you need to thrive. It is extremely important
                      that you pick a destination that you love, want to explore and that is within your budget.
                      Most Higher Education providers choose their locations based on several factors, including safety. If
                      you’re unsure about a certain location, please ask our specialists safety questions that you may have.
                      Of course, mishaps happen anywhere and everywhere in the world, but the chances are higher in some
                      Countries than others. You may also want to consider if your preferred program has a lot of other
                      international students especially if you love meeting people from diverse nationalities and making new
                      friends. Always, factor in the exchange rate and average cost of living in preferred location before
                      you make a final decision.
                      Study abroad is a time to enrich your educational experience – not cause additional stress—hence one
                      of the reasons to make use of our specialized service tailored to your unique needs. We will ensure
                      your application stays on track and that you meet all major requirements before you apply to a
                      specific program. Program lengths vary significantly.</p>

                    <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                      interests and budget. It is highly essential when deciding on your dream program and location to set a
                      realistic budget. Consider what you need versus what you want. If you’re looking to be as
                      cost-effective as possible, you may need to make a few compromises with yourself in choosing your
                      program. For example, a course that includes an additional study abroad year different from the
                      country you intend to study at may sound amazing but in reality, you may not be able to afford the
                      extra cost that comes with it. Instead, you could opt for a program that offers placement and would
                      give you the opportunity to earn while studying. You also may want to make a list of things that you
                      need in a program as against superfluous perks that you want and see where you may be able to cut
                      costs.
                      Costs always vary based on where you decide to go and selected program. When choosing the best program
                      for you, think of the extra factors that you need to budget for such as living expenses,
                      transportation in your new city. Different countries have different living expenses and this is a very
                      important factor to consider in addition to tuition fees which vary in figures from low to high
                      depending on the University, its world ranking and location. Also important to note is the currency
                      exchange rate which differs from one country to another.
                      If you’re not too confident in your ability to stick to a budget while living abroad, then you may
                      want to consider a program that has more inclusive packages such as outright payment of yearly
                      accommodation costs in addition to paying full tuition fees. There are so many different types of
                      programs out there, when discussing with our study abroad consultants; be honest with your budget and
                      expectations and that way we will provide tips on locations, Universities and courses in your budget
                      range. Don’t forget to research scholarship and funding opportunities too! We will do our best to

                        <li>Other Special Considerations: Social media question on visa applications. We encourage clients
                          to be conscious of the use of social media as this may be scrutinized for country-specific visa
                          application.</li>
                        <li>Immigration history: It is important to keep track of every past immigration history, every visa
                          issued, refusals, overstay in visited countries and make known every detail so that we can address
                          any issues in the application and or refer you to an immigration lawyer depending on the severity
                          of the case.</li>

                          applications can be tracked online for some countries.</li>
                        <li>Third country nationals for clients who are not citizens or permanent residents of the country
                          in which they currently live or the country where they plan to apply for a visa (i.e. you are a
                          "third country national). A valid explanation has to be given on why application is being made in
                          a country different from home country and explain plan to return to that country or home country
                          upon completion of studies.</li>
                        <li>Criminal records: Honesty is the best policy and clients should indicate every criminal
                          record, convictions, arrests, deportation from any country or previous ban details. In cases such
                          as these, we encourage Clients to seek the professional services of an experienced immigration
                          attorney to address current or past legal issues.</li>
                        <li>Final check of all visa application documents to ensure all requirements have been met before

                  a few institutions in your country offers it. E.g. Polymer and textile engineering in Nigeria is

                <h3>SELECT YOUR STUDY DESTINATION</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget. The ideal destination will vary based on your study abroad goals. When picking a
                  location, consider what type of living experience you want, available funds, your preferred
                  geographical environment (weather and culture). If you’ve always wanted to explore other countries
                  while studying, consider studying at a university that gives you the chance and visa to explore other
                  countries. Your study abroad experience is truly a product of what you make of it, so choose your new
                  home and study destination based on the factors that you need to thrive. It is extremely important
                  that you pick a destination that you love, want to explore and that is within your budget.
                  Most Higher Education providers choose their locations based on several factors, including safety. If
                  you’re unsure about a certain location, please ask our specialists safety questions that you may have.
                  Of course, mishaps happen anywhere and everywhere in the world, but the chances are higher in some
                  Countries than others. You may also want to consider if your preferred program has a lot of other
                  international students especially if you love meeting people from diverse nationalities and making new
                  friends. Always, factor in the exchange rate and average cost of living in preferred location before
                  you make a final decision.
                  Study abroad is a time to enrich your educational experience – not cause additional stress—hence one
                  of the reasons to make use of our specialized service tailored to your unique needs. We will ensure
                  your application stays on track and that you meet all major requirements before you apply to a
                  specific program. Program lengths vary significantly.</p>

                <h3>STRATEGIC BUDGET MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>Students aspiring to study abroad find it difficult to select country and university matching their
                  interests and budget. It is highly essential when deciding on your dream program and location to set a
                  realistic budget. Consider what you need versus what you want. If you’re looking to be as
                  cost-effective as possible, you may need to make a few compromises with yourself in choosing your
                  program. For example, a course that includes an additional study abroad year different from the
                  country you intend to study at may sound amazing but in reality, you may not be able to afford the
                  extra cost that comes with it. Instead, you could opt for a program that offers placement and would
                  give you the opportunity to earn while studying. You also may want to make a list of things that you
                  need in a program as against superfluous perks that you want and see where you may be able to cut
                  costs.
                  Costs always vary based on where you decide to go and selected program. When choosing the best program
                  for you, think of the extra factors that you need to budget for such as living expenses,
                  transportation in your new city. Different countries have different living expenses and this is a very
                  important factor to consider in addition to tuition fees which vary in figures from low to high
                  depending on the University, its world ranking and location. Also important to note is the currency
                  exchange rate which differs from one country to another.
                  If you’re not too confident in your ability to stick to a budget while living abroad, then you may
                  want to consider a program that has more inclusive packages such as outright payment of yearly
                  accommodation costs in addition to paying full tuition fees. There are so many different types of
                  programs out there, when discussing with our study abroad consultants; be honest with your budget and
                  expectations and that way we will provide tips on locations, Universities and courses in your budget
                  range. Don’t forget to research scholarship and funding opportunities too! We will do our best to
                  provide hints on available scholarships and funding opportunities.</p>

                      situation and visa history are addressed in detail taking into great consideration review of
                      countries’ specific requirements.</li>
                    <li>Other Special Considerations: Social media question on visa applications. We encourage clients
                      to be conscious of the use of social media as this may be scrutinized for country-specific visa
                      application.</li>
                    <li>Immigration history: It is important to keep track of every past immigration history, every visa
                      issued, refusals, overstay in visited countries and make known every detail so that we can address
                      any issues in the application and or refer you to an immigration lawyer depending on the severity
                      of the case.</li>
                    <li>Administrative processing delays – Sometimes delays occur due to different reasons and
                      applications can be tracked online for some countries.</li>
                    <li>Third country nationals for clients who are not citizens or permanent residents of the country
                      in which they currently live or the country where they plan to apply for a visa (i.e. you are a
                      "third country national). A valid explanation has to be given on why application is being made in
                      a country different from home country and explain plan to return to that country or home country
                      upon completion of studies.</li>
                    <li>Criminal records: Honesty is the best policy and clients should indicate every criminal
                      record, convictions, arrests, deportation from any country or previous ban details. In cases such
                      as these, we encourage Clients to seek the professional services of an experienced immigration
                      attorney to address current or past legal issues.</li>
                    <li>Final check of all visa application documents to ensure all requirements have been met before
                      submission. The Visa application process is comprehensive and takes a lot of time and that is why
                      we encourage students to apply as soon as possible. To prevent delays and last minute rush.</li>
