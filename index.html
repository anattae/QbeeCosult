              I was assigned to a particular staff that handled my case, I was given
              several university and master courses suggestions as I had provided the types of courses, I was interested
              in. it was finally narrowed down to forensic psychology at the university of Coventry, I wrote my personal
              statement and completed the necessary procedure, all my documents were cross checked by the staff and when
              all the documents were cleared my application was submitted and eventually i was accepted.

                    trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
                    undertaking, and
                    makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any
                    intended
                    results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate

                  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                    representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability

                    applicable
                    statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply
                    to
                    You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to
                    the
                    greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>

                    these
                    users.</p>
                  <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
